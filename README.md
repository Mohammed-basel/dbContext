# dbContext

This repository contains a *C#* program that demonstrates the use of *Entity Framework Core* to perform CRUD operations on a database. The program uses *SQL Server* as the database provider and *Code First* approach to create the database model. You can perform the following operations with the program:

- Add a new student
- Update an existing student
- Delete a student
- Display all students
- Exit the program


## About the project

This project was a small task I did when I was training with *iconnect technologies*. It is a simple example of how to use Entity Framework Core to interact with a database in C#.
